# 0B Assignment

### Your Task

In `prog.js`, create a function called `greetUser` that, when called with a string representing a name, a boolean representing whether they are an administrator or not, and a number representing the hour of the day in 24-hour time, responds with a message greeting the user. Run it with Node to test each of the following examples:

- `greetUser("Colin", true, 10)` should log "Good morning, Colin! You have administrator access."
- `greetUser("Samantha", true, 15)` should log "Good afternoon, Samantha! You have administrator access."
- `greetUser("Gene", false, 16)` should log "Good afternoon, Gene!"
- `greetUser("Ty", false, 20)` should log "Good evening, Ty!"
- `greetUser("Burrell", true, 3)` should log "Good evening, Burrell! You have administrator access."

You can decide much of the implementation, including what the time cutoffs are.
